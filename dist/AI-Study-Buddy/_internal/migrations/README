# Alembic Migration Scripts

This directory houses Alembic migration scripts.

Use the following commands within a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    alembic revision --autogenerate -m "message"
    alembic upgrade head
    ```

    The first migration creates a minimal `app_meta` table. Future revisions will add tables for tasks, events, and other app data.
