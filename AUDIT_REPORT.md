# Audit Report

## Executive Summary
- **Milestone 1 (Foundation):** Partially Pass
- **Milestone 2 (Smart Task Integration):** Pass (tests cover merging and cursors)
- **Milestone 3 (Planner & Workers):** Pass
- **Milestone 4 (Calendar UI & Sync Hardening):** Pass with caveats (packaging and UI startup issues)

## Detailed Findings

### Bugs
1. **PyInstaller build requires `.env` file and fails if missing**
   - **Risk:** High – packaging step aborts without placeholder env.
   - **Repro:** `pyinstaller packaging/pyinstaller.spec --clean --noconfirm` -> error `Unable to find '.env'`
   - **Recommendation:** Update spec to use `.env.sample` or handle absence.

2. **Qt xcb platform plugin missing in runtime**
   - **Risk:** Medium – `scripts/dev_run.py` fails to launch without `libxcb-cursor0`.
   - **Repro:** `PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/dev_run.py`
   - **Recommendation:** Document dependency or provide fallback offscreen mode.

### Data Safety
- `.env` is git‑ignored and sample file added; no secrets observed in repository.

### UI/UX
- Headless environment prevents verifying UI responsiveness. Startup failed due to missing Qt plugin.

### Performance/Responsiveness
- Unit tests complete quickly (<2s). No evidence of long‑running operations on main thread from tests.

### Tests/Migrations/Tooling
- `alembic upgrade head` applies migrations through `0008_metrics_tables`.
- `pytest -q` passes all 52 tests (warnings about deprecated `utcnow`).
- PyInstaller build attempted but not completed due to missing `.env`.

## Recommendations
- Address PyInstaller `.env` requirement (see Issue: Packaging fails without `.env`).
- Document or package required Qt dependencies (Issue: Qt plugin not found).
- Consider replacing deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` with `datetime.now(datetime.UTC)`.
